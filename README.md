# Automatic-Audio-Book-Based-On-Emotion-Detection

## Introduction
* Topic: To recognize emotion from text
* Tasks
  * Pre-processing
  * Feature extraction
  * Classification

> Implement various kinds of classifiers with various methods and evaluate.
> * **Consider pre-processing** with Morphological analysis, emoticon, punctuation mark, etc.
> * **Consider feature extractor** with Word count, TFIDF, phrase(with polarity), etc.
> * **Implement various classifiers.** - Naïve Bayes, MaxEnt, LDA & SVM, deep learning(RNN, CNN)

## Requirements
* This program must be able to detect emotion from text.
* The program will include 7 kinds of emotion - Love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness, fear and neutral.
* A text must be classified by one kind of emotion(most likely emotion).

## Project Schedule
* Information Gathering & Understanding the Topic
* Identify research topics - the definition of emotions (academic research), etc.
  1. Study Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
  2. Study Python
  3. Read related articles
